## [Unreleased]

### ⚠ Dependency requirement updated (breaking)

The required rapier version is now >= 0.5.0 < 0.6.0.


### ⚠ New collision shapes (breaking)

The variants `Body::Capsule` and `Body::Cuboid` have been added.

### Fixes

* Misplaced debug render at startup


## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2021-01-30

### Features flags

* `3d` (enabled by default) Enable simulation on the 3 axes `x`, `y`, and `z`. Incompatible with the feature `2d`.
* `2d` Enable simulation only on the first 2 axes `x` and `y`. Incompatible with the feature `3d`, therefore require to
  disable the default features.
* `debug` Render collision shapes. Works only in 2d for now, support for 3d will be added later.

Important: Either `2d` or `3d` (but not both) must be enabled. If none or both of theses two features are enabled,
the `PhysicsPlugin` won't be available.

### PhysicsPlugin plugin

Add the `PhysicsPlugin` to setup collision detection and physics simulation. It also registers rapier's `RigidBodySet`
, `ColliderSet`, `JointSet`, `IntegrationParameters`, `BroadPhase` and `NarrowPhase` in the resources.

### Gravity resource

The resource `Gravity` defines the world's gravity. Gravity is disabled by default. You may override or mutate
the `Gravity` resource to change the world's gravity.

### Body component

A `Body` component can be added to make the entity a *dynamic* rigid body with the given shape.

The position of the body is defined by the bevy `GlobalTransform` component. Updating the `GlobalTransform`, will
teleport the body ignoring physics rules.

Every frame the `Transform` will be updated to reflect the body position in the world.

Heron will automatically handle replacement and removal of the body (when the component mutated/removed or when the
entity is despawned)

At the moment, only spheres are supported. More shape will be added in the future. Support for static and kinematic
bodies will be added later too.

### Velocity component

Add the `Velocity` component to an entity to define/update or read the velocity of a dynamic body.

The entity, must also have a `Body` component and a `GlobalTransform`.

### Restitution component

The `Restitution` component can be added to define the restitution coefficient of a body.

### CollisionEvent event

One can read from `Events<CollisionEvent>` to be notified when collisions start and stop.
